Functional Programming in Java will help you quickly get on top of the new, essential Java 8 language features and the functional style that will change and improve your code. This short, targeted book will help you make the paradigm shift from the old imperative way to a less error-prone, more elegant, and concise coding style that\'s also a breeze to parallelize. You\'ll explore the syntax and semantics of lambda expressions, method and constructor references, and functional interfaces. You\'ll design and write applications better using the new standards in Java 8 and the JDK. Print books will be available after the final version of Java 8 is released. Lambda expressions are lightweight, highly concise anonymous methods backed by functional interfaces in Java 8. You can use them to leap forward into a whole new world of programming in Java. With functional programming capabilities, which have been around for decades in other languages, you can now write elegant, concise, less error-prone code using standard Java. This book will guide you though the paradigm change, offer the essential details about the new features, and show you how to transition from your old way of coding to an improved style. In this book you\'ll see popular design patterns, such as decorator, builder, and strategy, come to life to solve common design problems, but with little ceremony and effort. With these new capabilities in hand, Functional Programming in Java will help you pick up techniques to implement designs that were beyond easy reach in earlier versions of Java. You\'ll see how you can reap the benefits of tail call optimization, memoization, and effortless parallelization techniques. Java 8 will change the way you write applications. If you\'re eager to take advantage of the new features in the language, this is the book for you.

JRuby is a fast, scalable, and powerful JVM language with all the benefits of a traditional Ruby environment. See how to consolidate the many moving parts of an MRI-based Ruby deployment onto a single JVM process. You\'ll learn how to port a Rails application to JRuby, get it into production, and keep it running. JRuby deployments have fewer moving parts and consume less memory than traditional Ruby deployments, but to deploy your apps on the JVM, you need to learn some new approaches. This book introduces you to three JRuby deployment strategies that will give you the performance and scalability you need while letting you use the language you love. You\'ll start by porting an existing application to JRuby, preparing the app to take advantage of the JVM platform. Then you\'ll use Vagrant and Puppet to build a virtual production environment so you have a stable, reproducible place to explore JRuby deployment. With your environment in place, you\'ll experiment with simple JRuby deployment with Warbler as you package your Ruby web application into a single file you can deploy to a Java application server. Next you\'ll set up the lightweight Trinidad web server to create a more flexible, modular deployment that fits more complex situations but still feels friendly and familiar to Ruby developers. You\'ll switch to powering your app with TorqueBox, an all-in-one JRuby environment that includes built-in support for messaging, scheduling, and daemons--perfect for handling the \"big jobs.\" Then, you\'ll set up a continuous integration environment with Jenkins so you can deploy like the pros.

Groovy has much in common with popular scripting languages such as Perl, Python, and Ruby, but is written in a Java-like syntax. And, unlike these other languages, Groovy is sanctioned by the Java community for use on the Java platform. Since it is based on Java, applications written in Groovy can make full use of the Java Application Programmer Interfaces (APIs). This means Groovy can integrate seamlessly with applications written in Java, while avoiding the complexities of the full Java language. This bare-bones structure also means Groovy can be used as an introduction to Java and to programming in general. Its simpler constructions and modern origins make it ideal as a first language and for introducing principles such as object-oriented programming. This book introduces all the major aspects of Groovy development and emphasizes Groovy\'s potential as a learning tool. Case studies and exercises are included, along with numerous programming examples. The book begins assuming only a general familiarity with Java programming, and progresses to discuss advanced topics such as GUI builders, Groovlets, Unit Testing, and Groovy SQL.

Using object-oriented principles, you can develop a domain model that all team members-including business experts and technical specialists-can understand. Even better, this model is directly related to the underlying implementation. But if you\'ve tried building a domain-driven application then you\'ll know that applying the DDD principles is easier said than done. Naked Objects, an open-source Java framework, lets you build working applications simply by writing the core domain classes. Naked Objects automatically renders your domain object in a generic viewer--either rich client or HTML. You can use its integration with Fitnesse to test-drive the development of your application, story-by-story. And once developed, you can deploy your application either to the full Naked Objects runtime, or within your existing application infrastructure. In this book, Dan Haywood first gives you the tools to represent your domain as plain old Java objects, expressing business rules both declaratively and imperatively. Next, you\'ll learn the techniques to deepen your design while keeping it maintainable as the scope of your application grows. Finally, you\'ll walk through the development practices needed to implement your domain applications, taking in testing, deployment, and extending Naked Objects itself. Throughout the book, you\'ll build a complete sample application, learning key DDD principles as you work through the application step by step. Every chapter ends with exercises to gain further experience in your own projects.

You\'ll start with the basics but quickly ramp up, creating loosely coupled modules that publish and consume services, and you\'ll see how to compose them into larger applications.
